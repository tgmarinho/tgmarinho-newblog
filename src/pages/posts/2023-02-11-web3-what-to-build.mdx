- Applications built on blockchain technology, which offer increased security and transparency.

#### Cryptocurrency exchanges

- Platforms that allow users to trade cryptocurrencies and digital assets.

#### Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)

- Digital assets that represent ownership of unique items, such as collectibles, artwork, and music.

#### Decentralized identity management

- Solutions that allow users to control their personal data and secure access to their online identities.

#### Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications

- Financial applications built on blockchain technology, such as lending and borrowing platforms, insurance, and remittances.

#### Supply chain management

- Blockchain-based solutions for tracking the movement of goods and ensuring transparency and accountability in supply chain operations.


These are some of the areas where developers can build web3 solutions, however, the technology is still evolving and new use cases are emerging.

Let's see what you can do with Web3 and IA in the future ;)
